How to Use Carly
--------------------


The first time you open Carly, you will be provided with a short startup survey that asks you for the times in the week during which you are not available.  Fill this out to the best of your ability -- it will help us schedule your events for you!  When you are done, click "Let's get started!".


From the main page of Carly, there are 3 main panels: the timeline view of all events scheduled for the week, a traditional weekly calendar view, and a sidebar containing all assignments you have in the near future.  You may navigate the weekly view by using the arrow keys on the keyboard, or by clicking the arrow buttons on the top of the window.


To schedule a new assignment, click the "New Assignment" button or use CTRL-N.  From this window you may fill out the expected number of hours it will take you to complete the assignment, as well as the subtasks it is comprised of.  When you are done, click "Submit", and the assignment will automatically be broken up into manageable time blocks and spread throughout your calendar.

If you would like to change the layout of the calendar, you are free to drag, lengthen, or shorten any block.  Additionally, if you realize that you are unavailable for a certain period that is not currently marked as unavailable, you may click on that time period of the calendar and an unavailable block will be added.

To delete or edit an assignment, click on it in the side bar and you will find buttons for both of these actions.

To edit your custom settings, you may use the "Settings" button from the main window, or use the CTRL-S shortcut.

To mark your percent-completion of a task, you may drag the sliders in the sidebar corresponding to each task.  If you fall further behind than you expected (or get further ahead) you may use these to remove or add, respectively, extra time from your schedule in order to compensate.


Happy scheduling! :)
